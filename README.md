```

## 1. Match Models to Capability and Cost

Using the most expensive model for every task wastes resources. Assigning difficult work to an inexpensive but unsuitable model reduces quality and safety.

`CLAUDE.md` defines each model's Cost, Intelligence, Taste, and role.

| Task | Assigned Model | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture and complex decisions | fable-5 | Strong reasoning and design quality |
| Refinement and high-quality code modifications | opus-48 | High taste at moderate cost |
| Adversarial review and advanced refactoring | gpt-5.6-sol | Independent verification and high code quality |
| Bulk implementation, analysis, and migrations | gpt-5.6-terra | Strong execution ability and cost efficiency |
| Routine builds, tests, and static checks | gpt-5.6-luna | Lowest cost for narrow, deterministic work |
| Lightweight relay for invoking GPT models | sonnet-5 | Handles invocation and records without doing the substantive work |

The governing priority is:

> **Intelligence > Taste > Cost**

Correctness and safety come first. Cost distinguishes between otherwise suitable models.

## 2. The Thin Wrapper Makes the Real Worker Explicit

Claude's native agent interface cannot directly select the required GPT model, so sonnet-5 acts as a thin wrapper.

```text
Lead orchestrator
      │ Task instructions
      ▼
sonnet-5 thin wrapper
      │ Record prompt + invoke codex exec
      ▼
gpt-5.6-sol / terra / luna
      │ Perform implementation, verification, or review
      ▼
input.md + output.md + result.md
```

The wrapper does not perform the substantive task. It records the instructions, invokes the selected GPT model, and preserves the resulting files.

The standard invocation path is `scripts/delegate.sh` (bash) or `scripts/delegate.ps1` (Windows PowerShell). Both record `input.md`, invoke `codex exec -m <model> --output-last-message`, preserve `output.md`/`result.md` and the Codex exit code, and guard the audit directory with an atomic per-target lock (stale-owner recovery, orphaned-Codex detection, no double writers). Contract tests live in `scripts/test_delegate.sh` and `scripts/test_delegate.ps1`.

This makes the actual working model visible in both the user interface and the audit trail.

## 3. `input.md`, `output.md`, and `result.md` Make Delegation Auditable

Every delegated task produces three files.

```text
agents/2026-07-10-01-example/01-terra-implement/
  input.md
  output.md
  result.md
```

| File | Contents | Primary Reader |
|---|---|---|
| `input.md` | Exact requirements and constraints sent to Codex | Worker and auditor |
| `output.md` | Complete Codex action, tool-use, and execution log | Auditor and troubleshooter |
| `result.md` | Final changes, verification, decision, and remaining risks | Parent agent |

The parent agent normally reads only `result.md`. It consults `output.md` when validating an important claim or investigating a failure.

Committing the three files (and the `scratchpad/` directory) to Git is optional and follows the user's preference; confirm with the user before including them in a commit.

This separation achieves two goals:

- The parent agent does not waste context on a long execution log.
- The complete behavior and evidence remain available for audit when needed.

## 4. Worktrees Prevent Conflicts During Parallel Work

If several implementation agents share one working directory, they can overwrite the same files or damage unfinished user changes.

Parallel implementation therefore runs in independent worktrees directly under the repository root.

```text
worktrees/
  error-contract/     ─ Dedicated branch A
  staged-qc/          ─ Dedicated branch B
  assembly-engine/    ─ Dedicated branch C
```

Each agent modifies only its assigned files and packages. Before integration, inspect its diff, commits, and verification results. After merging, remove the worktree and its temporary branch.

## 5. Use an Independent Reviewer When the Risk Justifies It

An author naturally carries the same assumptions into the review of their own solution. When a change is security-sensitive, concurrency-sensitive, migration-heavy, cross-cutting, public-facing, difficult to reverse, or otherwise high risk, use a separate gpt-5.6-sol agent to review it from the original request and repository evidence.

Independent review is optional for routine, narrow, deterministic work whose result is easy to verify directly.

```text
Implementation agent
    │ Patch + result.md
    ▼
Independent gpt-5.6-sol review
    ├─ approve
    ├─ approve with non-blocking notes
    └─ request changes
```

The reviewer does not trust the report by default. It inspects the code, diff, tests, and configuration directly, separates confirmed defects from plausible risks, and provides a concrete remediation path for every blocking issue.

## 6. Keep Code and Documentation Current Together

If the code changes without a corresponding update to `continue.md`, the next session may repeat completed work or start from the wrong point.

Update `continue.md` immediately when:

- A commit or merge is completed.
- A design decision changes.
- The next starting point changes.
- Run instructions, verification procedures, or cautions change.

## Repository Structure

```text
.
├─ CLAUDE.md                         AI operating rules
├─ continue.md                       Progress and next starting point
├─ design.md                         Approved goals and architecture
├─ idea.md                           Concepts and rationale
├─ problem.md                        Gaps between implementation and target
├─ report.md                         Subagent audit report
│
├─ history/
│  └─ tasks/                         Archived task records
│
├─ scripts/
│  ├─ delegate.sh / delegate.ps1     Standard delegation helpers
│  └─ test_delegate.sh / .ps1        Contract tests for the helpers
│
├─ agents/                           Delegation audit trail
│  └─ <date>-<NN>-<task>/
│     └─ <NN>-<actual-model>-<role>/
│        ├─ input.md
│        ├─ output.md
│        └─ result.md
│
├─ temp/                             Drafts and scratch work shared with the user
│
├─ scratchpad/                       Temporary information with no audit value
│                                    (used instead of the session-specific system scratchpad)
│
└─ worktrees/                        Isolated parallel implementation
   └─ <task>/
```

`<NN>` is a two-digit sequence number allocated automatically by the delegation helpers: per-date for task directories and per-task for role directories. An existing directory with the same slug/role is reused.

## Core Principles

The purpose of `CLAUDE.md` is not to burden an AI with a large set of rules. It preserves direction, quality, and traceability across multiple sessions and models.

Remember these five principles:

1. **Keep project knowledge in repository documents, not conversational memory.**
2. **Assign work to models according to capability and cost.**
3. **Record every delegation through input, output, and result files.**
4. **Isolate parallel implementation with worktrees and add independent review when the risk warrants it.**
5. **Update the handoff document whenever the code changes.**

When these rules are followed, a new contributor or AI session can continue the project under the same standards, and the team can always determine who did what and why.
